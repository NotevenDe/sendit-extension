# Sendit

English | [中文](README.md)

Sendit is a browser extension that turns on-chain charts into a live room. It overlays real-time danmaku on Kline charts and adds chat, comments, and voice rooms.

## Features

- Real-time danmaku overlay on Current Ca address
- Contract-address based chat and comment rooms
- Voice rooms in the extension popup/side panel


## Next Steps

- Add holding verification so that holders are specially marked in the chat.
- Add information interfaces to broadcast real-time signals directly via K-line danmaku, such as KOL buy actions or tweet alerts.
- Expand danmaku formats and interactive features morethan text, introduce gifts and effects (e.g. rockets, fireworks), with effects linked to token market-cap milestones and Kline price movements.
- Enrich danmaku content with additional context, such as CA analysis and highlights, and improve comment filtering and reward mechanisms to ensure higher-value discussions.
